# Roblox-Client-Optimizer

Project is managed by [OptiFury](https://optifury.com/).

RCO tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

As seen in Sharkblox and Rubie's YouTube videos!

The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).
## Discord
We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/optifury)!

If you need support, ask in the #help-me channel.
## Installation
You can use our installer and uninstaller files to install and uninstall the flags, but keep in mind this will not autoupdate, so keep an eye on our Discord server for update announcements so you know when to run the installer again.
<br></br>
Download them [here](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/releases/tag/Release) by clicking on RCO-Installer.cmd or RCO-Uninstaller.cmd.
<br></br>
See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7US2Zl47M) for information on how to install the flags manually.
